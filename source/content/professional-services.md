Pantheon Professional Services (**PS**) works closely with partners to provide customized solutions for the most complex technical challenges and ensure your success on Pantheon. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

## Site Migrations
The Site Migration service lowers the barrier to entry by leveraging our PS team and partners. Whether you are moving one or hundreds of sites to or within Pantheon, Pantheon Migration Services will help you get it done quickly and reliably.

### Site migration process overview

- **Qualification**: We get access to the servers or site archives we'll need to undertake the migration and identify business critical functionality that require special attention and testing.
- **Initial migration**: We use automated tools and processes to move code, databases and files, and to stand-up your new environments on Pantheon.
- **Test and patch**: We fine-tune the migration routine to ensure that everything is working as expected, supported by Visual Regression tools, and build out additional scripting and automated testing as needed. This provides a repeatable and auditable process, and enables pre-launch content syncing.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: You test the site yourself. We have mechanisms in place to report any issues that are found and work to resolve those issues.
- **Launch Planning**: We work with your team to do launch planning such as content resyncs, load testing, SSL certificate pre-provisioning, and more.
- **Launch**: Our team stands by during the DNS cutover to handle any potential migration issues and we stick around post-launch.

## Managed Updates
Keep your site up to date with minimal interruption to end users. Allow Pantheon’s PS team to apply core and contributed plugins/module updates.

Your Engagement Manager monitors the process and works with you to ensure that updates are being applied cleanly, minimizing interference with your day-to-day operations.

### Managed updates process overview

- Updates are detected per client-provided specifications.
- A Multidev environment is spun up, cloning DB/files from Live.
- Updates are applied to the Multidev environment and Visual Regression Tests (**VRT**) are run.
- Manual testing if required.
- If VRT passes, we merge the Multidev branch into Master and run VRT again.
- Repeat same process on Test.
- Backup Live environment and deploy updates to Live.

## Advanced CDN

Implement additional services like IP-based geolocation, extended WAF, Image Optimization, and Domain Masking using our advanced CDN implementation. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

### Advanced CDN process overview

- **Qualification**: A member of the PS team will talk with your technical team to assess your needs and determine if your business requirements can be served with Advanced CDN.
- **Scoping**: PS will work with your team to determine areas of responsibility for both PS and your team and to set timelines for the start and completion of work.
- **Configuration**: PS will set up your site(s) and configure both the Advanced CDN service and your CMS.
- **Launch**: PS will provide you with the information you will need to launch or re-launch your site on Advanced CDN.
- **Post-Launch**: PS provides up to 4 hours per quarter to address requests and changes to the Advanced CDN service throughout the lifetime of the contract.

## Pantheon Secure Integration
Provides a static outgoing IP address for use in IP whitelisting connections to external services. [Learn more about Secure Integration](/secure-integration) or [contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

## SSO/SAML
Single Sign-on to the Pantheon Dashboard. [Learn more about SSO for Organizations](/sso-organizations) or [contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

## Pre-launch Load Testing
Load tests can be critical steps in ensuring a successful launch. Using proprietary tools developed by the PS team we generate traffic to your Live site, simulating complex user interactions if needed. There is no better way to expose and identify potential performance bottlenecks before you’ve launched your site.

Load tests provide critical insight for how a site will perform in the wild and through peak traffic spikes. Load tests ensure that your website launches smoothly and that it is ready to absorb the high traffic that success brings. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

## Performance Deep Dive
Performance tests expose the root cause of performance bottlenecks and allow us to suggest application-level solutions to optimize performance and reduce errors. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.

## Custom Application Services
Ad hoc solutions to ensure the success of your application on Pantheon. Typically scoped on an hourly basis and provided by our Engagement Managers at Pantheon. [Contact us](https://pantheon.io/professional-services) for details.
